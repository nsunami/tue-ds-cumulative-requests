# Cumulative Area Plot for DS Responses

This R code creats a cumulative area plot for visualizing the data stewards requests over time

Note that the data in the data folder are randomly generated numbers. (They do not reflect our internal data.) I included it so that we know about the data structure we need. 

## Files

- `R/draw_cumulative.R`: The main file that will draw the plot

- `R/utilities.R`: Utility functions
